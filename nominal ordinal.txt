Nominal
o Nominal scales are used for labeling variables, without any 
quantitative value. “Nominal” scales could simply be called “labels.” 
o all of the scales shown below are mutually exclusive (no overlap) and 
none of them have any numerical significance.
o Properties: distinctness (= != are meaningful)
o Ex. ID Numbers, eye color, Zip Codes
• Ordinal
o With ordinal scales, the order of the values is what’s important and 
significant, but the differences between each one is not really known.
o Ordinal scales are typically measures of non-numeric concepts like 
satisfaction, happiness, discomfort, etc.
o distinctness and order, (= != < > are meaningful)
o Ex. Grades, ranks etc. 
• Interval
o Interval scales are numeric scales in which we know both the order 
and the exact differences between the values. 
o For interval attributes, differences between values are meaningful.
o Properties: distinctness, order and differences, (= != < > + - are 
meaningful)
o Ex. Calender dates, temperature in Celsius
• Ratio
o For ratio attributes, both differences and ratio are meaningful. 
o They have an absolute 0. 
o Properties: distinctness, order, differences and ratios (= != < > + - * / 
are meaningful)
o Ex. Temperature in Kelvin, age, mass.
